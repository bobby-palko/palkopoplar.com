      The entrance to the Farmers Market is not well marked; we will have it decorated so you can find it easily. If you're driving in, once you turn towards the Aldi's Supermarket, keep going! You're almost there!</p>

    question: 'Shuttle Info',
    answer: `<p>
    If you're staying at one of the <a href="/stay">hotels we've partnered with</a>, we'll have a shuttle to transport you to and from the venue. The two hotels are on adjacent properties, and the shuttle will leave from the parking lot between them at 5:30pm. It will depart the venue at midnight to return to the hotels. We'll have the bus stocked with some goodie bags for the ride! Please note: the bus ride is about 45 minutes each way.

    question: 'Dress Code',
    answer: `<p>
    Formal? Semi-formal? Black Tie? We have a hard enough time figuring it out ourselves! Simply, we ask that you wear something nice and traditionally wedding appropriate. While you don't need a suit and tie, please leave the jeans at home.
